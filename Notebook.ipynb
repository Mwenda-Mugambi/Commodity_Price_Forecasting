    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "The focus of this project is to analyze and predict the dynamics of food commodity prices in various regions of Kenya. This initiative is essential in a country where agriculture is not only a key economic driver but also vital to the sustenance of its population. The fluctuation in food prices significantly impacts consumers, retailers, farmers, and policymakers. Understanding these price trends and being able to forecast future changes are crucial for effective agricultural planning, budgeting, and policy-making."
