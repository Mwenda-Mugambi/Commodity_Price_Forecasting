    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "The focus of this project is to analyze and predict the dynamics of food commodity prices in various regions of Kenya. This initiative is essential in a country where agriculture is not only a key economic driver but also vital to the sustenance of its population. The fluctuation in food prices significantly impacts consumers, retailers, farmers, and policymakers. Understanding these price trends and being able to forecast future changes are crucial for effective agricultural planning, budgeting, and policy-making."

    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project was obtained from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), specifically from the World Food Programme's food price database for Kenya. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-kenya).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is particularly suitable for our analysis due to the following reasons:\n",
    "1. **Comprehensiveness**: It covers a wide range of food commodities and spans multiple regions within Kenya.\n",
    "2. **Relevance**: The data directly relates to the prices of food commodities, which is the central focus of our project.\n",
    "3. **Timeliness**: The dataset includes recent data, which is crucial for accurate forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll load the dataset and take a preliminary look at its structure, types of data it contains, and any initial observations we can make about it."
