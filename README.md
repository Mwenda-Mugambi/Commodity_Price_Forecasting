# Commodity_Price_Forecasting
We aim to launch a comprehensive project to analyze and predict the dynamics of food commodity prices in various regions of Kenya. The project will utilize time series analysis to understand trends, fluctuations, and seasonality in the prices of different commodities across various markets.



# Business Understanding
The prices of agricultural products are subject to frequent and unpredictable fluctuations.These price movements have significant impacts on the livelihoods of farmers, the profitability of wholesalers and retailers, the affordability and accessibility of food for consumers, and the stability and security of the food system.

There is a need for a reliable and timely forecasting model that can predict the future prices of agricultural products based on historical data and current market conditions. Such a model will help the stakeholders to plan, budget, and optimize their production, consumption, and distribution strategies, as well as to anticipate and mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with the price fluctuations.

In Kenya, where 35.6% live below the international poverty line, challenges include 29% of rural children experiencing stunted growth. With a total population of 48.5 million, securing nutritious food remains a struggle for many. Addressing a third of the population's difficulty in accessing quality food is crucial, aligning with the global goal of zero hunger.

This project responds to these challenges, aiming to provide actionable insights into food commodity price trends and future predictions in Kenya. By employing data science and time series forecasting, the initiative seeks to contribute to more stable and predictable food markets in the country. Further, the project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the food system.
